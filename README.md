# US_Census_DataAnalysis

The data was collected by the US Census Bureau (2015). It has 3220 rows and 11 columns. There were two of the following csv files present on Kaggle.

https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/

acs2015_census_tract_data.csv: Data for each census tract in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico.
acs2015_county_data.csv: Data for each county or county equivalent in the US, including DC and Puerto Rico.

The two files have the same structure, with just a small difference in the name of the id column. Counties are political subdivisions, and the boundaries of some have been set for centuries. Census tracts, however, are defined by the census bureau and will have a much more consistent size. A typical census tract has around 5000 or so residents.
